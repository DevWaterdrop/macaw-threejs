# Overview

Macaw Three.js is ready to use library to connect Three.js with your project.<br/>
Under the hood is a fully optimized, clean Three.js set up to make it easy to implement effects for images (future text, etc.). With effects out of the box, you don't even need to know how to create/code them!<br/>
But if you're brave 🗡, you can comfortably implement your effect using the provided API.<br/>
